    The root task stays alive and becomes a *child* of every child —
    when all children reach ``done``, the root promotes to ``ready`` and
    its assignee (typically the orchestrator profile) wakes back up to
    judge completion or spawn more work.

    The root may be ``triage`` (a fresh fan-out) or ``blocked`` (a resume
    fan-out: an operator split a stuck card into children). 2026-09-01
    incident: a resume fan-out linked children as *children of the blocked
    root* (root as parent) while also making the root a child of every
    child — the promoter only dispatches a child once all its parents are
    done, so children waited on the root and the root waited on the
    children: 63 minutes, zero runs, manual unlink to recover. Children
    are therefore NEVER linked under the root's ``parent`` column; the
    root is always a *child* of each child (children runnable immediately,
    the closing card waits on them).

    ``children`` is a list of dicts, each shaped like::

        {
            "title": "...",
            "body": "...",                     # optional

            "parents": [0, 2],                 # indices into this same children list
        }

    Returns the list of created child task ids (in input order) on
    success. Returns ``None`` when:
      - The root task does not exist
      - The root task is not in ``triage``/``blocked``
      - A cycle would result (caller built a bad graph)

    Validation of titles/assignees happens inside the same write_txn as
    the inserts so a malformed entry aborts the whole decomposition
