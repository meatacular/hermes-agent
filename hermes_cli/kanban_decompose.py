"""Kanban decomposer — fan a triage task out into a graph of child tasks.

Invoked by ``hermes kanban decompose [task_id | --all]`` and the gateway
dispatcher's auto-decompose path. Reads the profile roster (with
descriptions), asks the auxiliary LLM for a task graph in JSON, then
atomically creates the children, links them under the root, and flips the
root ``triage -> todo``. The root stays alive as parent of every leaf child so
it wakes back up when the graph completes and its assignee (the orchestrator
profile) can judge completion and add more work.

Mirrors ``kanban_specify`` (lazy aux import, lenient parse, never raises on
expected failures). ``fanout=false`` collapses to the ``specify`` behaviour
(tighten + promote, no children), making ``decompose`` a strict superset.
Unknown assignees are rewritten to ``default_assignee`` — a child NEVER ends
up with ``assignee=None``.

_SYSTEM_PROMPT = """You are the Kanban decomposer for the Hermes Agent board.

A user dropped a rough idea into the Triage column. Your job is to break it
into a small graph of concrete child tasks and route each one to the best-
matching profile from the available roster.

You will be given:
  - The original task title and body
  - The list of available profiles (each with name + description)
  - The fallback "default_assignee" used when no profile fits

Output a single JSON object with this exact shape:

  {
    "fanout": true,
    "rationale": "<one sentence on why this decomposition>",
    "tasks": [
      {
        "title": "<concrete task title, imperative voice, <= 80 chars>",
        "body":  "<detailed spec for the worker on this child task>",
        "assignee": "<profile name from the roster, or null for default>",
        "parents": [<int>, ...]
      },
      ...
    ]
  }

Rules:
  - "parents" is a list of INDICES (0-based) into this same "tasks" list,
    expressing actual data dependencies. Tasks with no parents run in
    PARALLEL. Tasks with parents wait until every parent completes.
  - Prefer parallelism. If two tasks can be done independently, give
    them no parents so the dispatcher fans them out at once.
  - Use 2-6 tasks for normal work. Don't create 20 tiny tasks. Don't
    cram everything into 1 task.
  - Pick assignees from the roster by matching the task to the profile's
    DESCRIPTION (not just the name). When nothing matches well, use null
    and the system will route to the default_assignee.
  - Each child task body is what a fresh worker will read with no other
    context — be specific about goal, approach, and acceptance criteria.

When the task is genuinely a single unit of work (no useful decomposition),
return:

  {
    "fanout": false,
    "rationale": "<one sentence>",
    "title": "<tightened title>",
    "body":  "<concrete spec for a single worker>",
    "assignee": "<profile name from the roster, or null for default>"
  }

In that case the task stays as one work item, just with a tightened spec and
a concrete assignee. If no profile fits, use null and the system will route to
the default_assignee.

No preamble, no closing remarks, no code fences. Output only the JSON object.
