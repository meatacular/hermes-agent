"""Calibration set for the mint guard: every card minted on 2026-09-12, real titles.

The three BLOCK cases are the day's actual defects. The ALLOW cases are every other
card of that day — the false-positive calibration. A guard that blocks a legitimate
card stops the board, which is worse than the defect it prevents.
