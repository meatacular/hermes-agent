"""Kanban block -> OVERWATCH escalation plugin (rewritten 2026-09-06, plan O1).

Subscribes to ``kanban_task_blocked`` and, for every block that is a real
fault signal, spawns ONE fresh Agent Smith session ("overwatch", profile id
``default``) with a machine-built situation brief. Smith assesses the card in
the context of the whole board, acts within a written authority, and hands the
hard stops to Richie.

Richie's decision, 2026-09-06: "a fresh chat with Smith is triggered, he
assesses and acts to get things moving or tidy up the mess ... as quickly,
hygienically and cheaply as possible, while still delivering the feature to
the agreed quality, including all the agreed review and testing gates. Smith
may approve up to another $0.50 per card. At $1.50 the card is blocked and
Smith texts me a full rundown."

This replaced three mechanisms that disagreed with each other: a per-kind
routing table (Jobsy vs Smith vs Steve-o by substring), Steve-o cost
adjudication with two extensions, and ``dependency-gate-watch`` minting
``[triage]`` cards for give-ups. Measured on 5-6 Sep: 85 blocks, of which 15
were ``operator_hold`` by design and 28 dependency waits that needed nobody;
14 cost breaches each spawned ~4 more cards.

Triggers (read from the board, never from substrings of the reason text):
  cost_cap, capability, needs_input          -> always
  transient                                  -> on the SECOND occurrence
Never: operator_hold (Richie's decision), dependency (self-resumes),
scheduled (a date, not a fault).

Hard stops (no overwatch; ceiling marker for escalation-watch -> Richie):
  * the card already carries TWO overwatch decisions;
  * a cost_cap block on a card that was already extended once, or whose cap
    is already at kanban.max_cost_hard_ceiling.
On a hard stop ONE more Smith session is spawned with the RUNDOWN prompt:
write the rundown as a comment; escalation-watch (15 min, iMessage + Slack)
carries it to Richie.

Guardrails: never break the block transaction (every probe is best-effort);
fire-and-forget spawn in its own session; ``switch`` is never a target.
