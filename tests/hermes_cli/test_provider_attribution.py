"""Provider attribution — the fleet's longest-standing silent failure.

2026-09-05. `session_model_usage` has had `provider_name`, `native_tokens_prompt`,
`native_tokens_cached`, `cache_discount` and `total_cost` since 2026-09-01;
`conversation_loop` has always passed all five through to the writer. Yet **0 of
5,387 rows** carried a real value, because nothing in the transport ever put
them on the response object: `getattr(response, "provider_name", "")` returned
"" every single time, and the docs recorded the feature as working.

That blindness is why DeepInfra overcharging 11x went uncaught — every usage row
said "openrouter", so `cache-hit-watch` averaged a 96.8%-discount host together
with a 0%-discount host and stayed silent.

Measured the same day: the SAME model on the SAME minute cost $0.000572 on Z.AI
and $0.002839 on Novita/GMICloud — 5x, invisible in the ledger.

Every test here has a negative control: each asserts the value is extracted AND
that a response without it stays at the default, so the suite cannot pass by
extracting nothing.
