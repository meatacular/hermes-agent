"""Executable tests for the three-way clean-exit classification (t_8fc16a73).

Three unrelated faults used to produce the identical error string
"worker exited cleanly (rc=0) without calling kanban_complete or kanban_block
— protocol violation", which made any one of them disproportionately expensive
to diagnose. They are now split:

  * ``provider_error``  — fast provider spawn-bounce (403/429/5xx billing wall).
    Released WITHOUT consuming the failure budget or the protocol-violation
    streak; handed to the circuit breaker (fleet pause).
  * ``workspace_error`` — workspace / worktree / git contention. The card is
    BLOCKED with ``capability`` kind instead of retried into the same broken
    workspace.
  * ``no_checkpoint``   — the genuine case: a model that finished but never
    checkpointed. Keeps today's bounded retry.

Each test asserts the distinct error text, the ``violation_class`` machine
field, and the retry-budget effect (no failure-consumption regression).
