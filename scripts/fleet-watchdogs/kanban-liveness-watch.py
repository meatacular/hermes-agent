"""Kanban liveness + stale-diagnosis watchdog (no_agent, silent unless wrong).

Solves two recurring fleet failures, both of which burned agent-hours this week:

  1. STALE DIAGNOSIS — a card is spawned to fix a bug that is already fixed on
     disk. The worker reads a stale report, re-diagnoses the old crash, and
     spawns a rework card for a defect that does not exist. This script reads
     every `blocked`/`todo`/`ready` card whose body or latest comment cites a
     code defect ("X does not exist", "no attribute", "no such table",
     "AttributeError", "missing") and verifies the cited symbol/file against the
     workspace tree. If the claimed-missing symbol resolves on disk, the card's
     premise is stale -> flag hard.

  2. LIVENESS DEADLOCK — live gateways exist but no worker is running and
     cards sit `ready`/`todo` for too long, OR the dependency graph has a card
     whose parents include an archived card (an archived parent can never reach
     "done", so the child is permanently stuck). Both are silent stalls.

Wire-up: `no_agent` cron, 1-minute interval (or 5m after the board stabilises).
Silent-on-healthy: empty stdout = no action. Non-empty stdout = delivered to the
operator / wakes the orchestrator to act.

Usage:
    kanban-liveness-watch.py                 # report only (cron default)
    kanban-liveness-watch.py --audit          # always print, for smoke-testing
